This doc file is to give thanks to all the people that is currently contributing or who has contributed in the past to the patreon of the asset. The support there has been huge and it has a been a really humongous help to keep working on the asset and has allowed me to get elements to improve the asset (from artist to make designs, animations, etc... to hardware for PC parts, a VR kit and more).

So thanks to all of them, not only for their interest in the asset and their purchase, but for the even further support, proving a trust in the asset and its development, which is trully appreciated.

Here a list of these users (if you are some of the previous or present patreons and you notice that you are not in this list or your name is not correct, please, let me know about it and I will fix it asap):
