Thank you very much for your purchase and interest in this asset.

I have been working almost 3 years on it, 2 of them while I was studying and working. Now, I am trying to make asset development my work. 

So if you have downloaded this asset illegally (or "free") and you find it useful, please, consider to purchase it to support me, so I can keep working on it and bring new content, updates, features, tutorials and more.

For those who would like more direct input into the development of this asset, along with access to development versions please take a look at my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/twocubesstudio/overview) page and consider making a small monthly donation (from as little as $1 a month). While I love this work, I do need to eat.

I have planned to work on this asset forever, but this will decide how much time I can spend on it.
