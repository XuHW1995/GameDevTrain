While finishing the content of update 2.9, the original doc file of this documentation file was corrupted and not being able to recover. But fortunately, I was able to keep a copy on google docs, though most content has been disorganized, some captures are broken and more.

For that reason, I included this old version of the doc. Ignore the first part about first steps and basic used, for that, use the main doc file in the parent of the documentation folder.

The rest of content of this doc is not updated to the current content of GKC and its workflow, but after the release of this version 2.9, I will work in the doc, to organized it better, add the new content and update the previous one with the new elements, changes and workflow improved for all the elements in GKC.

New content will be added and posted in the forum and the discord channel, so stay tunned. The doc in the asset will be included as well.

Thanks for your attention and sorry for the inconvenience.
